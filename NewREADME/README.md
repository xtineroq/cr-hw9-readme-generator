  ## ➤ Contributing
  If you have come this far you are probably interested to figure out how to use README templates. This library comes with a set of pre-defined templates to make your readme awesome, but you can of course create your own. More about that later, let's not get ahead of our self just yet.

  ## ➤ Tests
  Use the placeholder {{ template:logo }} to stamp it. You will need to add the logo field to your blueprint.json. The logo field requires an src field. Optionally you can provide values for width, height and alt. Below is an example on how to add the data for the logo template.
